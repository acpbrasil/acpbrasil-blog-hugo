Advanced Care Partners (ACP) was founded in 2010 with the objective of changing the lives of nurses and families with sick entities, providing differentiated care in home nursing care to pediatric and adult patients.

In the US, families of patients with fragile medical conditions who require the same level of care as if they were hospitalized receive government support for home-based nursing care at no cost. The US government hires companies like ACP to provide nursing care to these patients in the comfort of their homes.

In eight years, ACP has become a national reference, integrating since 2015 the prestigious list of the INC 5000 that annually evaluates the fastest growing companies in the USA. All this due to the seriousness and commitment of the ACP with its nurses, patients and relatives.

Part of ACP's success is based on its unique culture of going beyond teamwork to achieve excellence in service. In the ACP, we take care of each other as a family, aligned with mutual respect and sharing the same values. The greatest proof of our success is demonstrated when 90% of the nurses hired come from indications from the ACP members.

In recent years the shortage of nursing professionals has been warning the American health system. It is estimated that by 2022 there will be over 700,000 jobs available in the nursing area. Understanding this scenario, and considering the quality of nurses trained in Brazil, ACP along with its Brazilian partners is seeking qualified and committed professionals who have the dream of building a successful career in the United States. We are here to make this dream become a reality.
